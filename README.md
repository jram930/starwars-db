# starwars-db

A database to curate knowledge about the Star Wars Extended Universe (EU) from four years after the Battle of Yavin (4 ABY) onnward (as that is the time period of books I tend to focus on reading).

For now this repo is concerned with getting the broad strokes of knowledge going by scraping [Wookiepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) for a large portion of the database. Once that is in decent shape I plan on curating it with my own notes as I continue reading the books.

Currently focused on capturing:
- Books
- Characters
- Planets

Eventually would like to focus on some variations of the following:
- Events
- Vehicles
- Weapons
- Factions

Once the databaase is in decent shape would like to serve it up in at least tabular format on a website.
